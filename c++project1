#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() 
{
    cout << "\n\n Find Size of fundamental data types :\n";
	cout << "------------------------------------------\n";
   cout << " The sizeof(char) is :          " << sizeof(char) << " bytes \n" ;
   cout << " The sizeof(int) is :           " << sizeof(int) << " bytes \n" ;
   cout << " The sizeof(float) is :         " << sizeof(float) << " bytes \n" ;
   cout << " The sizeof(double) is :        " << sizeof(double) << " bytes \n";
}
